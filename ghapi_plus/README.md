# ghapi-plus

## Note

This library is still a work in progress, and the initial versions of the [CLI](/ghapi-plus-cli/) and [GUI](/ghapi-plus-gui/) use raw `ghapi`. In the future this library will be used instead, however that will come with a major version bump, as many things may break.

## About

This folder holds the source code for the main `ghapi` wrapper. Since it's just the backend wrapper, it's only useful to developers to depend on this project without modifing the [CLI](/ghapi-plus-cli/) or [GUI](/ghapi-plus-gui/) versions.

~~In theory, the CLI and GUI versions could use direct `ghapi`, but I think it's easier to wrap it, and other developers can then use the wrapper.~~ Read [this](#note).
